# Sentiment Analysis using TFIDC and FC Neural network layer on IMDB Movie Review Data

## Data Set:
The labeled data set consists of 50,000 IMDB movie reviews, specially selected for sentiment analysis. The sentiment of reviews is binary, meaning the IMDB rating < 5 results in a sentiment score of 0, and rating >=7 have a sentiment score of 1. No individual movie has more than 30 reviews. The 25,000 review labeled training set does not include any of the same movies as the 25,000 review test set. In addition, there are another 50,000 IMDB reviews provided without any rating labels.

I will perform Sentiment Analysis using multiple variations. Here are a few listed below:

* Sentiment Analysis using TFIDF and Fully connected (FC) neural network.
* Sentiment Analysis using Embedding and Fully connected (FC) neural network.
* Sentiment Analysis using Pre Trained Embedding model and CNN.
